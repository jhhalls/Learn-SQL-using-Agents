[b][color=ff66cc]Explanation:[/color][/b] This SQL query is trying to get the list of employees who do not have a supervisor or manager.

The tables involved are "employee". The columns involved are "first_name", "last_name", and "super_id".

SELECT clause is used to specify the columns we want to retrieve from the table. In this query, we want to retrieve "first_name" and "last_name" of the employees.

FROM clause is used to specify the table we want to retrieve data from. In this query, we are retrieving data from the "employee" table.

WHERE clause is used to specify the conditions for which we want to retrieve data. In this query, we want to retrieve rows where "super_id" is NULL, meaning the employee does not have a supervisor or manager.

The order of execution is: first, the database retrieves data from the "employee" table, then it filters the data based on the condition specified in the WHERE clause, and finally, it returns the "first_name" and "last_name" of the employees who do not have a supervisor or manager.

[b][color=ff66cc]Explanation:[/color][/b] This SQL query is trying to get a list of all columns in all tables within a particular database.

The tables involved are INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS, and the columns involved are TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME, and TABLE_SCHEMA.

SELECT clause: This clause is used to select the data we want to retrieve. In this case, we want to retrieve the TABLE_NAME and COLUMN_NAME.

FROM clause: This clause is used to specify the table from which we want to retrieve the data. Here, we are using the COLUMNS table from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.

WHERE clause: This clause is used to filter the data based on certain conditions. Here, we are filtering the data to only include tables from a specific database, specified by the TABLE_SCHEMA.

The order of execution of this query is: 
First, the FROM clause is executed, which gets all the data from the COLUMNS table. 
Then, the WHERE clause is executed, which filters the data based on the condition. 
Finally, the SELECT clause is executed, which selects the required columns from the filtered data.

The tables involved are "employee". The columns involved are "first_name", "last_name", and "super_id" from the "employee" table.

The SELECT clause is used to specify which columns we want to retrieve from the table. In this case, we want to retrieve the "first_name" and "last_name" columns.

The FROM clause is used to specify the table we want to retrieve data from. In this case, we want to retrieve data from the "employee" table.

The WHERE clause is used to specify conditions for which rows we want to retrieve. In this case, we want to retrieve rows where the "super_id" is NULL, meaning the employee does not have a supervisor.

The order of execution of this query is: first, the database system reads the FROM clause to know which table to retrieve data. Then, it reads the WHERE clause to know which conditions to apply. Finally, it retrieves the specified columns from the rows that satisfy the conditions.

In this case, we want to combine rows from the "works_with" table with the "employee" table where the "emp_id" is the same in both tables. The "w" is an alias given to the "works_with" table for simplicity.

[b][color=ff66cc]Explanation:[/color][/b] This SQL query is trying to find the names of employees who have total sales of more than $50,000.

The tables involved are "employee" and "works_with"
* The "employee" table has columns like "first_name", "last_name", and "emp_id".
* The "works_with" table has columns like "emp_id" and "total_sales".

The query uses the following clauses:

SELECT - This clause is used to choose the columns we want to display. In this query, we are selecting "first_name" and "last_name" from the "employee" table.

FROM - This clause is used to specify the table(s) we want to retrieve data from. In this query, we are retrieving data from the "employee" table, and we are giving it an alias "e".

JOIN - This clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. In this query, we are joining the "employee" table with the "works_with" table on the condition that the "emp_id" in both tables should be the same. We are giving the "works_with" table an alias "w".

WHERE - This clause is used to filter records. In this case, we are only including rows where "total_sales" in the "works_with" table is more than 50000.

[b][color=ff66cc]Explanation:[/color][/b] This SQL query is trying to get a list of full names of employees.

The table involved is "employee" and the columns involved are "first_name" and "last_name".

SELECT clause is used to specify the columns that we want to retrieve. In this case, we are using a function CONCAT to concatenate "first_name" and "last_name" with a space in between. This new column is given the alias "full_name".

FROM clause is used to specify the table from which we want to retrieve the data. In this case, it's the "employee" table.

There are no conditions in this query.

The order of execution of the query is: the database system reads the FROM clause first, then applies the SELECT clause to the data retrieved from the "employee" table.

The tables involved are "employee" and "works_with".

The columns involved are "first_name" and "last_name" from the "employee" table, and "emp_id" and "total_sales" from the "works_with" table.

The SELECT clause is used to specify the columns we want to retrieve. Here, we're selecting "first_name" and "last_name" from the "employee" table.

The IN clause is used to check if a value exists in a list. Here, it's used to find the "emp_id" in the "employee" table that exists in the list of "emp_id" from the "works_with" table.

The subquery, which is the query inside the parentheses, is used to find the "emp_id" from the "works_with" table where "total_sales" less than 50,000.

The WHERE clause is used to specify the conditions. In this case, the condition is "total_sales" less than 50,000.

The order of execution of this query is: 

First, the subquery is executed, which finds the "emp_id" from the "works_with" table where "total_sales" less than 50,000. 

Then, the main query is executed, which finds the "first_name" and "last_name" from the "employee" table where "emp
